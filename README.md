Enzyme retrieves and helps synthesize your Obsidian notes right in the editor. It features:

- **Chat in markdown**: Chat UI that works entirely in Markdown / YAML (like a Jupyter Notebook for your notes)
- **Navigable output**: Renders relevant block embeds inline with the generated output, so you can navigate to the source
- **Flexible retrieval**: Powerful note retrieval powered by Dataview and extensible content extraction (a la YAML in a codeblock). Embedding-based retrieval is on the roadmap.
- **Workflow templates**: Re-curate your notes as they update, with workflow templates powered by Obsidian Canvas
